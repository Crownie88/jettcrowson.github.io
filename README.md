#####Version History

######V0.1
- Added `buyCommand` function
- Added `help` function with specific command help
- Added data sizes of byte->kb->mb etc
- Added `buyData` and `sellData`
- Removed the auto unlocking of commands

#####Todo:
- Add storage sizes
- Add save and load function
- Add upgrades
- Add virus and antivirus
- Add upgrades, both those bought with data or money
- Add a `dataStream` command that is more funny than useful. Example: [Name] likes [noun]: Jeremy likes shwarma. This would be so the user can "sample" their data.
- PLEASE COMMIT MORE TODOS
